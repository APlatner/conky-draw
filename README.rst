conky-draw
==========

Easily create beautiful conky graphs and draws.

The main idea is this: stop copying and pasting random code from the web to your monolithic conkyrc + something.lua. Start using a nicely defined set of visual elements, in a very clean config file, separated from the code that has the drawing logic.


Work in progress. Right now you can only define bar and ring graphs, but I'm working on:

* Being able to draw "plain" lines and circles, without values from conky.
* A short tutorial and some examples.
* Draw text elements (on arbitrary positions/areas, not like traditional conkyrc).
